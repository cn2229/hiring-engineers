Exercise:
1. Prerequisites - Setup the environment
	-Successfully set a Vagrant Ubuntu VM (v. 16.04, vagrant@ubuntu-xenial) with Datadog Agent metric reporting. 

2. Collecting Metrics:
Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.
	-Inserted the following line for the tags in the datadog.yaml file. Edited the file using $ sudo vi datadog.yaml 
	-"tags: tagkey_1:value_1, tagkey_2:value_2, tagkey_3:value_3"

Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.
	-Installed MongoDB v. 3.6

Create a custom Agent check that submits a metric named my_metric with a random value between 0 and 1000.

Change your check's collection interval so that it only submits the metric once every 45 seconds.

Bonus Question Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?
	- Yes, reviewing the documentation it is noted that you can change the collection interval in seconds by editing the my_check.yaml file under conf.d. You can simply add the following line under instances "-  min_collection_interval: 45"
